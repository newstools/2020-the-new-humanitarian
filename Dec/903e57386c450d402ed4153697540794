The Patrick J. McGovern Foundation has awarded a grant of $500,000 to support The New Humanitarian’s independent journalism about humanitarian crises. COVID-19 has been described as an “extinction event” for the news media, but it has also reminded audiences around the world of the importance of reliable information about crises. The New Humanitarian reports from the heart of humanitarian crises, as well as from global policy and donor hubs. “The pandemic has pushed our beat into the global limelight. This new consciousness is an opportunity to bring our journalism to wider audiences,” said Heba Aly, director of The New Humanitarian. “The New Humanitarian has not just survived in the face of COVID-19, but thrived, and this support will allow us to scale up our journalism at a time when it has never been more needed.” The grant will further journalism that informs global policy and response on the critical issues of our time. TNH journalism holds the aid sector accountable and amplifies the voices of people living through crises. “The New Humanitarian shines a light on global disaster and crisis, courageously asking hard questions and telling stories that might otherwise never be told,” said Foundation President Vilas Dhar. “In this time of global suffering and conflict, trusted, independent journalism is among our most powerful forces for social change towards a better future.” The legacy of global media publisher Patrick J. McGovern, the Foundation’s focus includes bringing trusted data, analysis, and storytelling to policymakers and the public, and supporting vulnerable communities through the pandemic. The New Humanitarian's funding comes from a mix of governments, foundations, readers, and charged services. We strive to ensure diversity in the sources of our funding in order to maintain our editorial independence and our long-term financial sustainability.
